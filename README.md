# _Brief Description about this Portfolio:_

- I built this portfolio in order to show the world some of the interesting projects I have worked on. Gatsby is a nice tool to create faster sites than similar types of sites. It has an implicit security since there is no database or server.

- While working on this App, using Gatsby makes it faster to render the contents.
