My name is Ratongamanahaja Francois Valentino Jacquit, a student from Madagascar but studying in Mahanoro. I'm 23 years old. I'm studying at ONJA now to be a professional front-end developer.

I started studying at ONJA since january 2019. After a year of lerning English, we started learning Coding in january 2020. I found it unbeleivable to pursue the mutation from the background where there was no chance to learn about technology into learnig computer science. I have been learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and now I am learnig about React.
