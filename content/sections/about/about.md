My name is Ratongamanahaja Francois Valentino Jacquit, and I am 24 years old. I am a student from Madagascar. I'm studying to be a professional front-end developer at ONJA.

I started studying at ONJA in january 2019.
After a year of learning English, I started learning Coding in january 2020. I found it unbelievable to pursue the mutation from the background where there was no chance to learn about technology into learning coding. I have been learning HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, including Vanilla Javascript and React, and now I am learning about React Native. I am very passionate about learning new technology. I look forward to furthering my knowledge in computer science.
