I am Ratongamanahaja Francois Valentino Jacquit, an aspiring web-developer from Madagascar. I'm studying to be a professional programmer at Onja, a social business focused on delivering societal change through educational empowerment of underprivileged youth.

I started studying at Onja in January of 2019. After a year of learning English, I began my journey into coding, starting with HTML and CSS followed by JavaScript, React and now React Native and TypeScript.

Going into the future, I am very passionate about learning new technologies. I look forward to furthering my knowledge by learning new languages, exploring new fields of computer science and writing production-ready applications.
