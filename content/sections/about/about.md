I am Ratongamanahaja Francois Valentino Jacquit, an aspiring web-developer from Madagascar. I'm studying to be a professional programmer at Onja, a social business focused on delivering social change through educational empowerment of underprivileged youth.

I started studying at Onja in January of 2019. After a year of learning English, I began my journey into coding, starting with HTML and CSS followed by JavaScript, React and now React Native and TypeScript.

Coming from a background that did not have any opportunities to learn about modern technology, diving into coding has been a quite unbelievable experience for me, that I had to overcome to be able to start my journey in coding.
â€‹
Going into the future, I am very passionate about learning new technologies. I look forward to furthering my knowledge by learning new languages, exploring new fields of computer science and writing production-ready applications.
