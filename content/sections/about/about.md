I am Ratongamanahaja Francois Valentino Jacquit, an aspiring web developer from Madagascar. I'm studying to be a professional programmer at Onja, a social business focused on delivering social change through educational empowerment of underprivileged youth. I started studying at Onja in January 2019. After a year of learning English, I began my journey into coding, starting with HTML and CSS followed by JavaScript, React and now React Native and TypeScript. Coming from a background where I did not have any opportunities to learn about modern technology and coding, I had to start my journey learning to code the hard way. Looking ahead, I am very passionate about learning new technologies. I look forward to furthering my knowledge by learning new languages, exploring new fields of computer science and building meaningful applications.
