I built this app by practising my ability to use React. It shows you a question either about the capital or the flag of a country, and below that, four names of countries in which you click which is appropriate to the question above. When you get it right, the score increases, otherwise, there will be an option to continue or stop running the app. If you are interested in seeing how it works, click the demo icon.
