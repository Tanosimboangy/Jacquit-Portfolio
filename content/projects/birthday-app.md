This app is built with a combination of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. It displays lists of peopleâ€™s birthdays, which you can filter by names or months. You can also add new people, as well as edit and delete the existing ones.

Building this app helped me to understand more about concepts like filtering and DOM manipulation as well as working with libraries like DateFNS for date handling.
