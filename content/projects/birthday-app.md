This app is built with the combination of HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. Vanilla Javascript is used to handle all the functionalities. This app displays lists of peopleâ€™s birthdays. You can filter the lists by names or by months. You can also add a new person, edit and delete the existing one. Building this app helped me to understand more the concepts about Vanilla Javascript.
