I built this app using React and typeScript. It displays lists of the countries around the world and each list contains some information about each country. Clicking one list will redirect the user to the detail page, which shows the description geographical of the country, including its language and the border if there is. The form on top allows the user to filter the list according to their names and regions.

Building this app improved my understanding of the concept of typeScript, and enabled me to grasp the mechanism of switching mode.
