I built this landing page after only a few months of learning HTML and CSS. The goal was to create the whole page from scratch by utilizing semantic HTML elements and using CSS in order to match the design and make the page responsive. While working on this project, I learned to write clean, accessible HTML and follow best practices for responsiveness.
