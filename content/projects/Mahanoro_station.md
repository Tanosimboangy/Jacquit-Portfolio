I build this app in order to practice using redux, which is one of the best ways to handle state in react. It is an app that gives people access to book their trips online. Using Redux makes is more easier to handle the user's interactions and updating the state.

Building this App helped understand the concepts of sharing state management and see how that state is being updated over time.
